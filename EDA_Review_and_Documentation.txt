EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
REVIEW & DOCUMENTATION
COLLEGE STUDENT PLACEMENT DATASET

========================================
OBJECTIVE OF THE EDA
========================================
• Understand the overall structure of the dataset
• Identify important factors influencing student placement
• Analyze relationships between academic, skill-based features and placement status
• Prepare insights for future machine learning modeling

========================================
DATASET OVERVIEW
========================================
• Each row represents a student
• Columns include academic scores, skills, internships, IQ, projects, etc.
• Target Variable:
  - Placed = 1 (Student Placed)
  - Placed = 0 (Student Not Placed)

• Feature Types:
  - Numerical: CGPA, IQ, Internships, Projects
  - Categorical: Stream, Gender
  - Binary: Placement Status

========================================
DATA QUALITY CHECKS
========================================
• Missing Values:
  - Checked using df.isnull().sum()
  - No major missing values found (handled using mean/median where needed)

• Duplicate Records:
  - Checked and removed if present

========================================
UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
========================================
• Histograms used to understand individual feature distributions
• Observations:
  - CGPA follows near-normal distribution
  - IQ shows moderate variance
  - Internships and Projects are slightly right-skewed

========================================
BIVARIATE ANALYSIS (PLACEMENT VS FEATURES)
========================================
BOX PLOT INSIGHTS:
• CGPA:
  - Placed students have higher median CGPA
• IQ:
  - Higher IQ values observed among placed students
• Internships & Projects:
  - More internships/projects increase placement chances

VIOLIN PLOT INSIGHTS:
• Higher data density for placed students at higher CGPA and IQ
• Better understanding of data distribution and variability

========================================
CORRELATION ANALYSIS
========================================
• Correlation matrix and heatmap used
• Key Findings:
  - CGPA has moderate positive correlation with placement
  - Internships and Projects show positive influence
  - No strong multicollinearity observed

========================================
OUTLIER ANALYSIS
========================================
• Outliers detected in CGPA and IQ
• Outliers were not blindly removed as they may represent real cases

========================================
KEY INSIGHTS SUMMARY
========================================
• Higher CGPA improves placement probability
• Practical exposure plays a major role
• IQ supports placement but is not the sole factor
• Combination of features decides placement success

========================================
REAL-WORLD INTERPRETATION
========================================
• Students should:
  - Maintain strong academic performance
  - Complete internships
  - Build practical projects

• Colleges should:
  - Encourage internship programs
  - Focus on skill-based learning

========================================
CONCLUSION
========================================
• Placement success depends on both academics and practical skills
• EDA provides a strong foundation for predictive modeling
